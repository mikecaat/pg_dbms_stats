<h2 id="name">1. NAME</h2>
<p>pg_dbms_stats -- controls planner behavior by giving stored table statistics</p>

<h2 id="synopsis">2. SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL manages table statistics from sampled values of tables and indexes by ANALYZE command. Query optimizer calculates execution plan costs based on the statistics and chooses the plan with the lowest cost. On the mechanism, inaccuracy of statisctics or sudden change of data amount or distribution lets the query optimizer make unexpected or unwanted change of execution plan.</p>
<p>pg_dbms_stats is a extension that try to stabilize execution plan avoiding such kind of disturbance. It tries to stabilize planning by providing predefined "dummy" statistics instead of original values for requests from the planner. It is intended to be used by those who want to lower the risk that a unexpected change of execution plan leands to bad performance degradation on a system.</p>

<p>pg_dbms_stats can fix the statistics of the following database objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary tables</li>
<li>Idexes (having a restriction except for function indexes)</li>
<li>Foreign tables(PG9.2 and later)</li>
<li>Materialied views</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="description">3. DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>There are eight kind of operations pg_dbms_stats offers for manipulating statistics used by planner. All operations other than export are executed via SQL functionsã€‚See <a href="objects-en.html">TARGET OBEJCT LIST</a> for details.</p>

<h3>3.1. BACKUP</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Store the statistics that planner currently sees for later use to
let the planner behave in the same way as now.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Execute the SQL function backup_&lt;restore_unit&gt;_stats()</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The objects to store their statistics are specified by the unit of the whole databsae, schema, table and column.
For example, specify the schema when you want to store the statistics of all tables and columns in a schema. To keep things simple, it would be a good practice to specify the target objects in rather large sized unit like database or schema.</p>
<p>The backup history is seen in dbms_stats.backup_history table. The details are seen in <a href="objects-en.html#table">TABLES</a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>3.2. RESTORE</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Choose and load a backuped statistics so that planner behaves in the same way as the time of the backup.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Execute SQL functions restore_stats() or restore_&lt;restore_unit&gt;_stats()</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Resotore a backuped statistics for the specified objects. Planner continues to see the same statistics for others. There are following two ways to specify a backup.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Backup ID</dt>
<dd>By invoking the function restore_stats() with a backup ID, the backup with the ID is restored. It is the simplest way to restore a whole backup when you take backups in units of database or schema. The backup ID is unique within a database so make sure use a backup ID of the right database.</dd>
<dt>Object type and timestamp</dt>
<dd>By invoking the SQL function restore_&lt;restore_unit&gt;_stats()
with a timestamp, the statistics of the all objects in the specfied
unit are restored from the latest backup of each object before the
specified time. Planner sees the "real" statistics for the objects
that don't have a backup before the time. This method is useful when
you are taking statistics backups by smaller units and it is difficult
to identify a set of backup IDs to restore the status at a certain
time.</dd>
</dl>
Restore implies "lock" of statistics. No need of explicit lock of statitics after restoration.
</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>3.3. PURGE</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Performs a bulk deletion of backups no longer necessary. All backups taken before the speccified backup ID are deleted.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Execute the SQL function purge_stats() with a backup ID.</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>The backup ID must be specified to leave at least one database-wise backup but this restriction can be omitted by giving true as the "force" parameter.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>3.4 LOCK</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Stores the statistics at the time and show it to planner to let it behave in the same way thereafter.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Execute the SQL function lock_&lt;lock unit&gt;_stats() with the name of the target unit.</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lock units are one of database, schema, table or column.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>3.5. UNLOCK</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Deletes locked statistics and planner behaves in ordinary way thereafter.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Execute the SQL function unlock_&lt;unlock unit&gt;_stats() with the name of the target unit.</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Planner uses the "real" statitics stored in pg_class and pg_statistic for an object after unlocking of the object. The unlock unit is one of database, schema table and column. Unlock is allowed to execute with arbitrary unit unrelated to the unit specified as of locking.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>3.6. CLEANUP</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Remove all locked statistics of objects no longer exisrts.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Execute the SQL function clean_up_stats()</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dropping a table or a column doesn't delete locked statistics automatically. This function removes such orphan locked statistics at once.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>3.7. EXPORT</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Write out the current statistics to an external file.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Craft an SQL script based on the sample SQL files (export_&lt;stats type&gt;_stats-&lt;PG version&gt;.sql.sample) then execute it. "stats type" is one of plain or effective, which means the real statistics and the statistics pg_dbms_stats will offer respectively.</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Choose one of plain or effective according to the purpose. The output directory must be writable by the user which is running the server.</p>
<dl>
<dt>The "real" statistics of PostgreSQL</dt>
<dd>The statistics stored in pg_class and pg_statistics. This is usable for off-site analysis and tuning of a server. The exported statistics can be loaded using pg_dbms_stats on the analysing site.</dd>
<dt>The statitics currently in effect</dt>
<dd>The statistics that planner is looking through pg_dbms_stats. It is usable for loading a tuned statistics onto the service site or backing up an effective statitics into a plain file.
</dl>
</p>
<p>You can find the sample files in the "extension" subdirectory in the directory shown by "pg_config --docdir".</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>3.8. IMPORT</h3>
<dl>
<dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
<dd>Loads a plain file created by export and use it as a locked statistics.</dd>
<dt>USAGE</dt>
<dd>Execute the SQL function import_&lt;load unit&gt;_stats() with object name and the file to load.</dd>
<dt>DETAILS</dt>
<dd>
<p>The load unit is one of database, schema, table and column. The data in the import file that is out of the specified load unit is excluded on loading. The import file must be placed so that the server can read it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="install">4. INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>pg_dbms_stats can be installed in the ordinary method to load an extension.</p>

<h3>4.1, BUILD</h3>
<p>Just type "make" after setting PATH environment variable so that the right pg_config is executed. Then type "make install"by the same user with the installed server.</p>

<h3 id="create_extension">4.2. REGISTER AS AN EXTENSION</h3>
<p>pg_dbms_stats is a PostgreSQL extension, which requires "CREATE EXTENSION" to be executed.</p>
<p>Extension itself is dropped by DROP EXTENSION but the dbms_stats is left in place. Drop it manually if no longer needed.</p>

<h3>4.3. LOADING pg_dbms_stats</h3>
<p>pg_dbms_stats is dynamically loadable using LOAD command.
If you want enable pg_dbms_stats automatically in all sessions, add "pg_dbms_stats" to shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf then restart the server.

<p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>:
You will see the following lines in the log file for every statement by just loading pg_dbms_stats but not registering as an extension on the database. Make sure regstering on the database before you load pg_dbms_stats.
<pre>test=# SELECT * FROM test;
ERROR:  schema "dbms_stats" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT relpages, reltuples, curpages  FROM dbms_stats.relati...
                                                   ^
QUERY:  SELECT relpages, reltuples, curpages  FROM dbms_stats.relation_stats_locked WHERE relid = $1
test=#</pre>
</p>

<h3>4.4. INACTIVATE pg_dbms_stats</h3>
<p>To inactivate loaded pg_dbms_stats, set pg_dbms_stats.use_locked_stats to off.
<pre>test=# SET pg_dbms_stats.use_locked_stats TO off;
SET
test=# SELECT * FROM test; -- generates a plan based on the real statistics
...
test=# SET pg_dbms_stats.use_locked_stats TO on;
SET
test=# SELECT * FROM test; -- generates a plan based on the locked statistics
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>To turn off pg_dbms_stats on all sessions, set pg_dbms_stats.use_locked_stats to off in postgresql.conf then reload the config, or use ALTER SYSTEM for PG9.4 or later.
</p>

<h2 id="uninstall">5. UNINSTALLATION</h2>
<p>
Perform the following steps to uninstall pg_dbms_stats.
<i>dbname</I> is the name of the databases on which pg_dbms_stats is regsistered as an extension.
<ol>
<li>Type "make uninstall" in the build directory as the installation user.</li>
<pre>$ cd pg_dbms_stats
$ su
# make uninstall</pre>
<li>Enter "DROP EXTENSION" command on all databases that pg_dbms_stats is registered as an extension.</li>
<pre>$ psql -d <i>dbname</I> -c "DROP EXTENSION pg_dbms_stats"</pre>
<li>Remove dbms_stats schema if you no longer need the locked or backed up statistics.</li>
<pre>$ psql -d <i>dbname</I> -c "DROP SCHEMA dbms_stats"</pre>
</ol>
</p>

<h2 id="examples">6. EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>There are roughly three kind of operation styles. Mainly-backing-up, mainly-locking, mainly-exporting. Assume mainly-backup style if you are not sure which one of them fits your requirement.</p>

<h3>6.1. "MAINLY-BACKING-UP" OPERATION</h3>
<p>Take daily backups using backup_xxx() functions and restore only required statistics when you face a problem using restore_xxx() functions. Take database-wise backup if you don't have special requirements.</p>
<p>Restore the backed up statistics by specifying by backup ID or timestamp. Use backup ID unless you have difficulties to identify the target ID.
</p>
<pre>-- <b>Take a daily backup then ANALYZE.</b>
test=# <b>SELECT dbms_stats.backup_database_stats('any comment');</b>
 backup_database_stats
-----------------------
                     1
(1 row)

test=# <b>ANALYZE</b>;
ANALYZE
test=#
</pre>
<pre>-- <b>Restore and lock the statistics at the same time yesterday.</b>
test=# <b>SELECT dbms_stats.restore_database_stats(now() - '1 day');</b></pre>
<p><strong>CAVEAT</strong>:
As explained above, if there are no backups before the specified time for some columns or tables planner continues to see the statistics before the restoration. This might lead to unexpected behavior of planner.
</p>
<p>The following is an example of restore operation of a statistics backup. The "time" column shows the time of the backup.</p>
<pre>
test=# <b>SELECT b.id, b.time, r.relname
	 FROM dbms_stats.relation_stats_backup r
	 JOIN dbms_stats.backup_history b ON (r.id=b.id)
	ORDER BY id;</b>
 id |          time          |     relname
----+------------------------+-----------------
  4 | 2012-01-01 00:00:00+09 | public.droptest
  5 | 2012-01-02 12:00:00+09 | public.test
(5 rows)

test=# <b>SELECT dbms_stats.restore_database_stats('2012-01-03 00:00:00+09');</b>
 restore_database_stats
------------------------
 test
 droptest
(2 rows)

test=#</pre>

<h3>6.2. "MAINLY-LOCKING" OPERATION</h3>
<p>Execute lock_xxx() functions to just lock the statistics at the service start.</p>
<pre>test=# <b>SELECT dbms_stats.lock_database_stats();</b>
 lock_database_stats
---------------------
 droptest
 test
(2 rows)

test=#
</pre>

<h3>6.3. "MAINLY-EXPORTING" OPERATION</h3>
<p>To export the statistics under operation then import into another database, craft and execute a script based on the export_xxx_stats-<PG version>.sql_samplefiles then execute import_xxx() function on the another database.</p>
<pre>$ <b>cd pg_dbms_stats</b>
$ <b>psql -d test -f export_effective_stats-10.sql</b>
BEGIN
COMMIT
$ <b>psql -d test2 -c "SELECT dbms_stats.import_database_stats('$PWD/export_stats.dmp')"</b>
 import_database_stats
-----------------------

(1 row)

$
</pre>
<p>CAVEAT: The base script uses binary format of COPY command so import might fail if the format is incompatible with the export side. See <a href="http://www.postgresql.jp/document/current/html/sql-copy.html">COPY command</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="restrictions">7. NOTES</h2>
<p>There are some important poins and restrictions to use pg_dbms_stats.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Prerequisites</dt>
<dd>Make sure that the target objects have statistics before performing lock or backup of pg_dbms_stats. The operations in the case don't work as expected although you won't have no error message.
</dd>
<dt>Limitations on fixable objects</dt>

<dd>Since the ordinary index (that is, non-function/formula index) doesn't have column-wise statistics, columns-wise lock or backup does nothing.</dd>
<dt>Timing of statistics backup</dt>
<dd>Database triggers cannot be used  to automatically invoke locking or backing-up of statistics. Use external tools to run the set of ANALYZE and statistics backup as a job.</dd>
<dt>Other factors of planning change</dt>
<dd>Since this tool stores only statistics, despite of statistics locking the planner's behavior may change by settings of several <a href="http://www.postgresql.jp/document/current/html/runtime-config-query.html">GUC paremeters</a> that affect planning or significant change of the density of a relation.</dd>
<dt>Possible hook confclicts</dt>
<dd>Since pg_dbms_stats uses the following hook points it might conflict with tools that uses the same hook points.
<ul>
<li>get_relation_info_hook</li>
<li>get_attavgwidth_hook</li>
<li>get_relation_stats_hook</li>
<li>get_index_stats_hook</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Cautions on dump and restore of the database</dt>
<dd>
pg_dbms-stats uses anyarray type to store column statistics. The type information will be lost by dumping the values in text representation and restore will fail. Take the following steps to restore dbms_stats schema properly.
<ol>
<li>Dump the statistics managed by pg_dbms_stats in binary format into &ltfile name&gt.</li>
=# <b>COPY &ltname of a table of dbms_stats schema&gt TO '&ltfile name&gt' FORMAT binary;</b>
<li>Dump the other schemas in the an ordinary method.</li>
$ <b>pgdump --exclude-schema 'dbms_stats' &ltold DB name&gt &ltdump file name&gt</b>
<li>Restore the dump file.</li>
$ <b>pg_restore -d &ltnew DB name&gt &ltdump file name&gt</b>
<li>Install pg_dbms_stats.</li>
<li>Load the &ltfile name&gt into the tables in dbms_statas schema.</li>
=# <b>COPY &ltname of a table of dbms_stats schema&gt FROM '&ltfile name&gt' FORMAT binary;</b>
</ol>
</dd>
<h2 id="details">8. UNDER THE HOOD</h2>
<h3>8.1. Outline</h3>
<p>pg_dbms_stats lets planner to see dummy statistics instead of the real statistics it usually sees and stabilizes the execution plans. There are three sourcesof the dummy statistics.
<ul>
<li>Perform "lock" using the statistics at the present.</li>
<li>Perform "restore" using a backup.</li>
<li>Perform "import" using an exported file.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>pg_dbms_stats manages statistics using several tables and files.
<dl>
<dt>Currently effective statistics</dt>
<dd>Ths statistics planner actually sees, which is made by lock, restore or import functions.</dd>
<dt>Backed-up statistics</dt>
<dd>A set of statistics at a certain time generated by the backup feature of pg_dbms_stats. pg_dbms_stats can manage multiple backup sets in the history table. These backups is loaded in plance of the currently effective statistics by using restore function.</dd>
<dt>Exported statistics</dt>
<dd>A set of statistics on a database generated as an OS file by the export function. Multiple sets of statistics are exportable with different names. The exported statistics is loaded in place of the currently effective statistics by using import function.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>pg_dbms_stats doesn't change the real statistics shown in pg_class or pg_statistic catalogs.</p>
<img src="pg_dbms_stats-ja.png" />

<h3>8.2. User interface of pg_dbms_stats</h3>
<p>pg_dbms_stats manages statistics by updating the content of the statistics tables mentioned above. pg_dbms_stats provides the management SQL functions to update the tables keeping consistency. Manually manipulating the tables is discouraged.</p>

<h3>8.3. Statistics items pg_dbms_stats locks</h3>
<p>Planner calculates the cost of an execution plan based on the following statistics items or the real values. pg_dbms_stats locks or stores all of these statistics items. It even conceals the change of the size of relation files by replaceing with the size at the time of locked or backed-up.</p>
<ul>
<li>column value statistics calculated by ANALYZE (pg_catalog.pg_statistic)</li>
<li>number of tuples estimated by ANALYZE (pg_catalog.pg_class.reltuples)</li>
<li>relation file size at the time of ANALYZE (pg_catalog.pg_class.relpages)</li>
<li>relation file size at the time of planning</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.4. Manually operation of statistics</h3>

<p>Some columns in the statistics tables are of anyarray type thus they are inoperable from the genuine SQL interface. pg_dbms_stats has helper functions to manipulate the values of the columns since 1.3.7. This feature doesn't offer any fool-proof protection and improper manipulation not only lets planner do wrong but easily leads to a server crash. Be careful in using this feature.
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>You can inject values by the following three steps.
<ul>
<li>Identification of the base type of the anyarray for the target statistics item.
<p> You can do that by invoking anyarray_basetype() function giving the name of the target statistics column in column_stats_locked table.</p>
<pre>=# <b>SELECT dbms_stats.anyarray_basetype(stavalues1)
   FROM dbms_stats.column_stats_locked
   WHERE starelid = xxxx AND staattnum = x;</b>
 anyarray_basetype
 -------------------
  float4
 (1 row)
</pre>

<li>Preparation for injecting an array of the crafted values of the base type as the dummy statistics.
<p> A helper function and a cast required to inject dummy statistics are generated by invoking prepare_statstweak() function with giving the target base type as a text. The stuff is removed by drop_statstweak().</p>
<pre>=# <b>SELECT dbms_stats.prepare_statstweak('float4');</b>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     (func dbms_stats._realary_anyarray(real[]), cast (real[] AS dbms_stats.anyarray))
    (1 row)
</pre>
<li>Injection of statistics
<p>Everything is ready. The following statement updates the dummy statistics item.</p>
<pre>=# <b>UPDATE dbms_stats.column_stats_locked
    SET stavalues1 = '{1.1,2.2,3.3}'::float4[]
    WHERE starelid = xxxx AND staattnum = x;</b>
 UPDATE 1
</pre>
</ul>
